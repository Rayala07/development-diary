# 🚀 Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I’m building up my **Full Stack Web Development skills** — step-by-step, day-by-day.

This repo is organized into folders based on topics like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and more to come.  
Every folder contains hands-on practice files, exercises, and mini-projects I’ve worked on during my journey.
