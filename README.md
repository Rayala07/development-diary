# 🌐 HTML Learnings – Web Dev Journey

Welcome to the `HTML-learnings` folder of my **Web Development Learning Journey**!  
This section contains hands-on practice files and assets I’ve used while learning HTML fundamentals.  
Each file serves a specific purpose and reflects progress made while experimenting with tags, structure, forms, and media.

## 📂 What’s Inside

### 📄 HTML Files

- `document.html` – Practice file to understand basic document structure and semantic tags.
- `forms.html` – Hands-on with HTML forms: text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radios, textarea, and form submission elements.

### 🖼️ Images (Stored in `practice_images/`)
